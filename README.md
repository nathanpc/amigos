A super tiny, ultra portable, single file, standalone Gopher server written in
ANSI C. Also known as **a** **mi**cro **G**opher **s**erver.

This server implementation strictly follows [RFC 1436](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436),
with the exception of the `i` type that's commonly used in modern Gopher
implementations.
